  - My main function is to help schedule events. However, I can also give you information on any events for the group. This could range from event names and descriptions to timing (whether an event time is set or flexible to your preferences).
- - Could you explain event time to me?
  - Event timing works in two ways. Either an event is set or open-ended. is found from the group members preferences. When creating an event, you will have the option to choose.\nIf you set the event to open-ended, you can enter in the event you want to add your preferences to. Then, you may add dates that you would prefer to attend on.\n An expiration date will determine when to process all the preferences and calculate the best time.
- - What can you do?"
  - You can use me to help schedule events. For any 'open-ended event', you can set a time preference.\n To do this, first enter in an event name that has been created in your group and is open-ended. For example ":" 'Movies in the park'.\nThen, simply tell Clarence the dates you would like as your preference.\nAn example of this is":" 'Put me down for September 3rd at 9 am'. Your time preference will be added and taken into consideration when the best time is calculated!\nAdditionally, feel free to converse with Clarence. He can tell jokes, talk about himself and his feelings, or even gossip!
