- - What can you tell me?
  - My main function is to help schedule events. However, I can also give you information on any events for the group. This could range from event names and descriptions to timing (whether an event time is set or flexible to your preferences).
- - Could you explain event time to me?
  - Event timing works in two ways. Either an exact time is set or the best time is found from the group members preferences. When creating an event, you will have the option to choose.\nIf you set the timing to look for the best time, you can enter in the event you want to add your preferences to. Then, you may add dates that you would prefer to attend on. An expiration date will determine when to process all the preferences and calculate the best time.
