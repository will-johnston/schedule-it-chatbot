  - Hello!
- - What can you tell me?
  - My main function is to help schedule events. However, I can also create events for you or tell you events that you can give your time preferences to. Type "help" for a list of commands.
- - Could you explain event time to me?
  - Either an event is set or open-ended. When creating an event, you may choose either. If you set the event to open-ended, tell me your time preferences. An expiration date will determine when to process all the preferences and calculate the best time.
- - What can you do?"
  - Hi! Here are some commands you can use. Schedule events (must be open-ended) = "event name", "schedule me for [date]", Create event = "create event, [event name], [set/open-ended], [date/expiration_time], [description]", Show events = "show events"
- - How do you work?
